This Django project implements a very basic shoestore.

Please navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/shoestore/ to use the app once running on localhost by using python manage.py runserver in the top level directory.

To access admin features navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin, and login with credentials username="admin" password="adminpassword"

Users may also set up accounts, which can be done when using the application.

If there is any trouble running the application, please try running model migrations to make sure the database is setup correctly. (of course you can email me as well for help H09bryndavies@gmail.com)
